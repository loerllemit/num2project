    "This code is divided into three main parts implemented as classes: MolDyn, RDF, and Plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the MolDyn class, this will implement the core of the molecular dynamics simulations. The positions, velocities, and accelerations at each time steps are stored in the 3-dimensional arrays _pos_config_, _vel_config_, and _acc_config_. The first index is the timestep, the second is the particle number, and the third are the coordinates. For instance, _pos_config[120,64,1]_ returns the position(0->x,1->y,2->z coordinate) of the 64th particle for the 120th timestep.\n"

All the $N(N-1)/2$ distances computed from unique pairs of particles were used to create the histogram for a specific timestep. In other words, all the particles were considered as reference particles for computing the RDF. The obtained RDF should be then divided by $N$ reference particles. The final RDF was taken to be the average of 8 RDFs from equally spaced time intervals.\n"

Please make sure that **plots** and **data** folder are present in the same directory, else you need to create them.\n"
